OBO
===

A Python package for OBO ontologies with a reader and writer for the OBO format.

Motivation
----------

As a quick Google search will reveal, the choice of  OBO parsers for Python out there is virtually endless.
What would make this parser different from all the other parsers, is that it is the first one that isn't bundled with a
massive bioinformatics package and many dependencies, and that it will actually be submitted to PyPI (we can dream).

This package is fairly complete in what it parses, while still being simple to use and written in Pythonic python. The
parser currently ignores comments and trailing modifiers. There is also an experimental writer.


Installation
------------

::

    pip install obo
