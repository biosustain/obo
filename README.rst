OBO
===

**A Python package for parsing OBO files.**

Motivation
----------

As a quick Google search will reveal, the choice of  OBO parsers for Python out there is virtually endless.
What would make this parser different from all the other parsers, is that it is the first one that isn't bundled with a
massive bioinformatics package and many dependencies, and that it will actually be submitted to PyPI (we can dream).

This package is fairly complete in what it parses, while still being simple to use and written in Pythonic python. The
parser currently ignores comments and trailing modifiers.

What is still needed is an OBO Writer. So if you feel like coding one of those, write an issue and we will see if it can
be done.
